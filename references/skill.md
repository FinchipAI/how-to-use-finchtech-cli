# Skill Market

Source shape and content protection are independent choices. A Creator may publish one file or one directory using `plaintext`, `finchip_v2`, or `lit` when the selected deployment supports that mode. Never substitute a GitHub or arbitrary IPFS URL for a new local package.

## Session wallet intent handoff

With CLI 0.5.1 or newer, whose installed help supports `--intent`, pass `walletIntent.intentId` from MCP preparation to the corresponding `finch skill` local command. Purchase, conversion, price/supply, publication/version/presentation, cover upload and delivery use this immutable reference. `--from-file` carries the reference only; the CLI fetches authoritative preparation bytes using its Session. Deploy the intent migrations/endpoints and release CLI 0.5.0 before using this handoff. Updating this Skill does not update the executable.

Wallet actions must not create or read MCP business grants. Business reads and preparation remain in the Harness's Remote MCP connection. The CLI handles local files, encryption and private material, reconstructs/simulates/signs the prepared call, checkpoints its hash before waiting, and returns a wallet receipt. Read business results through MCP. For an unexecuted old plan without a reference, prepare again through MCP; never add a fabricated reference.

Use `finch skill recover intent <FINGERPRINT>` for purchase/conversion/price/supply/presentation wallet results and `finch skill recover publication <FINGERPRINT>` for publication material. Follow the exact returned command. Known receipts can resume confirmation without repeating wallet work, and projection lag retains the journal. Existing buyer journals can acquire only a receipt-only reference after canonical transaction verification. Existing publication material journals retain conservative recovery; missing keys or unknown send outcomes require reconciliation, never blind resubmission.

## CLI 0.3.8 publication and delivery

Require CLI 0.3.8 or newer before these workflows. All downloads, including plaintext, require the intended Account's active AgentCLI Session. The CLI supplies its bearer to the official delivery gateway and acknowledges verified downloads before returning bytes for the output file; never construct the request or expose the bearer yourself. This version also supports staged uploads, the 30 MiB package ceiling, and manifests with authorized external media. Older clients can reject those manifests or packages above their bundled limit. Updating this Skill alone does not update the CLI.

For a single local `.zip`, request a `file` source plan and pass the ZIP path to the returned `finch skill publish-submit` or `finch skill version-submit` action. The CLI expands it before filtering and primary-Markdown hashing. ZIP files inside a directory remain ordinary assets. Include `SKILL.md`, `README.md`, or one unambiguous root Markdown document with valid UTF-8. Imports accept stored/DEFLATE ZIPs up to 30 MiB compressed and expanded and at most 1024 entries; unsafe paths, symlinks, encrypted ZIPs, ZIP64, conflicts, and corrupt content are rejected. The final package must also fit 30 MiB including metadata and encryption overhead, so a source at the import ceiling may still be too large after packaging. Correct the source rather than bypassing validation.

New Skill identities use a SkillRoot commitment; historical identities retain ZIP-hash updates. Pass the user's optional summary unchanged during preparation; omission means an empty summary. Let the CLI calculate commitments and preserve its uploaded bytes and journal when resuming a publication.

Protected Finch-managed and Lit downloads use Oracle V2 grants sealed to a temporary local device key. Let `finch skill download` perform the request, verification, and local decryption; never request or expose a bare content key. The CLI verifies the SkillRoot and every file, or the historical plaintext ZIP hash, before writing an ordinary ZIP. It retains historical package support. Authorized recipients can still copy decrypted content.

## Search continuation and fresh publication signatures

Pass the returned `nextCursor` unchanged to the `cursor` input of `skill_market_skills_list`, retaining the same filters. Treat cursors as opaque strings, never integers. Restart from page one after a stale or filter-mismatched cursor; Keep discovery in Remote MCP.

Finch-managed publication key requests carry a signed timestamp and are consumed once. If a request expires or was used, sign a fresh request through the updated CLI; never replay the old signature. Keep any existing transaction or publication journal and follow its typed recovery path. Lit publication is unchanged.

## Chain identity

Every concrete Skill is identified by `(chainId, skillId[, version])`. PROD discovery may return Ethereum `1`, Optimism `10`, BNB Smart Chain `56`, Base `8453`, Arbitrum `42161`, and Avalanche C-Chain `43114` records in one result set. Preserve the returned `chainId` through detail, delivery, purchase, conversion, publication/version preparation, Manage, confirmation, recovery, and every CLI local action. Never infer it from the CLI login profile, a contract address, or a previous result, and never retry a missing-chain request against Base: Ethereum/Optimism and BNB/Arbitrum reuse contract addresses, and Avalanche's SkillToken address is also Arbitrum's RevenueRight address.

Before any Avalanche custody action, verify `finch --version` reports CLI `0.5.1` or newer; CLI `0.4.0` cannot execute plans for `43114`. Request an upgrade before executing the plan when this requirement is unmet. Avalanche prices and gas use AVAX. CLI 0.5.1 includes Avalanche in PROD authentication; select a supported chain from `finch login --help`, then preserve the exact chain in the business plan. A Browser wallet on Avalanche authenticates on Avalanche with the current PROD server.

The Remote MCP plan is the market-chain authority. Finch CLI selects the source-controlled chain definition, contract authority, envelope tag, and public RPC for that exact plan chain. Do not set `FINCH_ENVIRONMENT`, `FINCHTECH_RPC_URL_<chainId>`, or `FINCH_RPC_URL_<chainId>`; installed CLI ignores them. The only optional endpoint override is the protected profile installed by the TEST Skill.

## Creator

Use `skill_market:discover` and `skill_market:creator:write`.

1. Collect a unique slug, name, protocol category, source path, file-or-directory source kind, optional summary (up to 500 characters), content mode, license, price, maximum supply, usage limit, optional platform display category, and required public presentation. Do not guess economics or publish a repository root.
2. Prepare publication through MCP, call `identity_actor_get`, compare it with `finch status`, and hard stop if Account, wallet, or environment differs. Show the exact custody summary for approval, then run the returned `finch skill publish-submit` action. Packaging, filtering, deterministic ZIP creation, optional encryption, upload, key custody, and chain submission stay local.
3. Prepare a public cover upload through MCP and run `finch skill asset-upload`; then prepare presentation and run `finch skill presentation-submit`. Presentation may include bounded summary, description, tags, parameters, dependencies, capabilities, compatibility, repository and documentation links, support, release notes, and related public metadata.
4. Use Manage reads before changing anything. Manage supports platform display category, related Skills, unit price, maximum supply, public presentation, public HTML documents, and a new file-or-directory version. Use the corresponding MCP preparation and returned `finch` action (`price-submit`, `supply-submit`, `presentation-submit`, or `version-submit`), repeating the MCP/CLI identity comparison before each custody action. Re-read chain, presentation, and document state after each change.
5. Preserve the protected local recovery journal until all multi-transaction publication or version stages settle. Resume only with `finch skill recover publication <FINGERPRINT>` using the non-secret 64-hex fingerprint printed by the CLI. Do not expose journal contents, rerun a broadcast stage, delete local state, or create a replacement Skill after an unknown outcome.

`plaintext` needs no purchase or holding, but its Finch delivery requires login. A zero-priced protected Skill is still protected and still requires acquisition before key release. `finchip_v2` and `lit` are distinct existing envelope modes; do not translate or invent cryptographic data between them.

### Public HTML documents

Manage Information, Instruction, Benchmark, and Showcase HTML through Remote MCP; no separate CLI upload command exists or is needed. Before changing documents, call `skill_market_manage_get` for the exact `(chainId, skillId)`. Preserve its complete `presentation` value and inspect the required `documents` summary, whose four kinds are each either an admitted-content summary or `null`. A temporary `SKILL_MANIFEST_UNAVAILABLE` means the public IPFS gateways have not completed the read; retry the same Manage request instead of treating every kind as absent.

Call `skill_market_presentation_prepare` with the same `chainId`, `skillId`, and complete current `presentation`, plus `documentUpdates` only when changing documents. The update is explicit by kind:

- Omit a kind to preserve it.
- Set a kind to `null` to delete that whole kind.
- Set a kind to `{ "html": "...", "assets": [...] }` to replace that whole kind, including its complete asset list. `assets` is required and may be empty; omitted assets are removed rather than preserved.

An inline asset is `{ "filename": "style.css", "mediaType": "text/css", "contentBase64": "..." }`. An already uploaded detail asset may instead use `{ "filename": "image.png", "mediaType": "image/png", "storedURI": "<returned detail-storage locator>" }`; use exactly one representation. Preserve a real locator returned by a supported upload path; a local path, cover CID, or invented locator is not a detail upload. Use a flat filename and a media type matching the extension and actual bytes; the server reads and revalidates stored assets. HTML cannot be empty or whitespace-only.

The request must satisfy both the 3,000,000 inline decoded-byte content limit and the 4,000,000 serialized-arguments limit. Stored asset bytes do not spend the inline budget, but HTML plus all assets still must fit the 4 MiB per-document ceiling. If no supported upload path or existing locator is available, report that missing input instead of fabricating an upload command or routing blindly to the browser. Keep each whole-kind replacement complete.

External media requires an operator grant for both the publishing wallet and each exact HTTPS host. The grant covers `img`, `video`, `audio`, `source`, and CSS backgrounds; scripts, iframes, remote stylesheets/fonts, credentials in URLs, non-default ports and unapproved hosts remain refused. Create the Skill first, then add granted documents through presentation preparation; initial creation cannot name external hosts. Published documents retain their recorded hosts. Withdrawal blocks subsequent publication, including unchanged carried-forward documents, but does not disable media on an already published page. Request operator assistance for a grant; an ordinary market operation does not authorize editing Ops policy. The browser publish wizard still refuses external media and uses its existing multipart upload transport.

Document preparation stores a content-addressed derived manifest and waits for the same public IPFS gateway path used by CLI 0.2.1. During gateway warm-up, `SKILL_MANIFEST_UNAVAILABLE` is recoverable: retry the exact same prepare payload after a short wait. Do not alter `presentation`, assets, or document intent between those retries. Other validation errors require fixing the request rather than retrying it unchanged.

After prepare succeeds, repeat the MCP/CLI identity check and run the returned plan unchanged with `finch skill presentation-submit --intent <INTENT_ID>` with the returned `walletIntent.intentId`. The CLI locally retrieves the derived manifest, preserves all unmodified documents and versions, applies the prepared presentation, re-encodes `setSkillURI`, signs, and broadcasts. Re-read `skill_market_manage_get` and the public content routes after confirmation; a deleted document route must return `404`.

### Related Skills and Referenced By

A Skill's detail page lists up to 12 Related Skills chosen by its owner. Set them with `skill_market_related_skills_update` for the exact `(chainId, skillId)`; it writes immediately, off chain, and needs no `finch` action, signature, or gas. The list is replaced whole and in display order: read the current `relatedSkills` from `skill_market_manage_get`, then send the complete list you want; an empty list clears it. Each entry is a market card id: `skill_protocol_v3:<chainId>:<skillId>` for a V3 Skill (build it from a `skill_market_skills_list` result), or `legacy:<chainId>:<decimal uint160 of the Chip address>`. The Skill itself, duplicates, and ids the market does not currently list are refused; `RELATED_SKILL_NOT_LISTED` names the ids to drop or correct.

"Referenced By" is not writable. It is derived: every Skill you list shows yours under its Referenced By, and yours shows every Skill whose owner lists it. Do not try to set it through presentation, documents, or any other field.

## Buyer

Use `skill_market:discover` and `skill_market:buyer:write` as needed.

1. Search or list, then inspect the exact Skill ID and version, owner, price, supply, content mode, package hash, presentation, and delivery terms.
2. Verify the intended Account with `identity_actor_get` and `finch status`. Download `plaintext` content through the official delivery plan while logged in, without purchasing. For protected content, prepare purchase through MCP, call `identity_actor_get`, require exact equality with `finch status`, show the transaction summary for approval, and run the exact `finch skill purchase-submit` action. The command validates `signingAuthority`, broadcasts once, checkpoints the transaction hash before waiting for a receipt, and confirms atomically.
3. Read delivery through MCP and run `finch skill download` to a new protected output file. Pass the authoritative plan unchanged so the CLI retrieves the package through the authenticated delivery gateway, verifies the SkillRoot and every file or the historical plaintext ZIP hash, and acknowledges the download before creating the file. If acknowledgement fails, do not claim the file was saved: resolve the reported failure and retry the download with the same intended Account and plan. Do not purchase again or alter transaction journals to repair a download.
4. When moving an owned holding to a newer compatible version, prepare conversion through MCP, repeat the identity comparison, and run `finch skill convert-submit`; verify the old/new balances and download the selected version explicitly.

If purchase or conversion times out after broadcast, recover only with `finch skill recover intent <FINGERPRINT>`. Recovery verifies the recorded transaction's sender, recipient, calldata, and value before waiting and confirming; it never broadcasts again. A buyer-intent journal containing a transaction hash can only be recovered, never abandoned or deleted by hand. Keep journal secrets private. Logout and wallet switching preserve the journal; recovery requires its original wallet and matching Account/environment.

Skill catalog and holdings are chain-authoritative, while projected search may converge after a confirmed transaction. Never treat an older search projection as permission to override the current chain-authoritative detail.

## Publication diagnostics and recovery (CLI 0.3.7+)

Parse the JSON string in `error.state` for source diagnostics (`SKILL_SOURCE_SYMLINK_UNSUPPORTED`, `SKILL_SOURCE_UNREADABLE`) and final upload size (`SKILL_UPLOAD_SIZE_INVALID`, `actualBytes`, `maxBytes`). Paths are relative to the selected source. The CLI sends final multipart requests up to 4,000,000 bytes inline and automatically stages larger ones; the old near-limit warning and 4,500,000-byte local refusal no longer apply. Final packages are bounded at 30 MiB (31,457,280 bytes), covers at 5 MiB and manifests at 3 MiB. Upload and download share the package ceiling. Browser publishing still uses multipart and is not a 30 MiB upload path. Source ZIP import has its own compressed/expanded check; metadata, repacking and encryption may increase final size.

Staged upload failures can include `uploadTransport`, `uploadBytes`, `uploadObjectKind`, and `ticketReleased`. A failed release may retain a ticket: finish or release it through the supported client, or follow the returned expiry guidance. Sequential requests are limited to four outstanding tickets per wallet; tickets older than 24 hours are swept when that wallet next requests one. This is not a scheduled bucket-wide cleanup. Never print a signed upload URL or token.

For `SKILL_SOURCE_ZIP_INVALID`, inspect `zipReason`: `archive_too_large`, `expanded_content_too_large`, `utf8_flag_missing`, `filename_encoding_invalid`, or `invalid_archive`. Size errors include `actualBytes`, `maxBytes`, and `sizeBasis` (`archive` or `declared_expanded`); a safe relative entry path may be present. Non-ASCII ZIP filenames require valid UTF-8 bytes and bit 11 in the headers. Rebuild an invalid archive; these input failures use exit code 2 and `fix_request` before upload.

Skill operation and transport errors report HTTP status and available safe correlation IDs; legacy publication diagnostics identify `/api/skills/intents`; current wallet execution uses the owned Skill intent resource. `responseIssue` distinguishes transport/body/JSON/schema failures; `schemaIssues` is bounded and contains no response values. Diagnostics do not repair server-side failures or Harness OAuth. Use returned remote IDs for support; the publication fingerprint identifies a local journal, not a server trace. A download `output_destination` refusal concerns the requested output directory/file, not the wallet store; use a new file at the documented protected destination.

Publication failures report `phase`, `fingerprint`, `transactionHashes`, `submissionStatus`, `unconfirmedActions`, `resubmitSafe`, and `recoveryCommand`. Follow the returned `retryable` and `nextAction` together: a confirmed transaction with a pending projection is not proof that every required transaction finished. Re-read the Skill and use a supplied recovery command after comparing CLI/MCP identity. `not_attempted` describes this invocation, not previous attempts; `hash_known` is not a successful receipt by itself. Fingerprint-only recovery can reuse stored bytes. Never print journals or credentials.

Journal v6 records pending stages before submission. Unknown creation, version, or delivery-key outcomes still block blind resubmission; read the specific chain state named in the error and contact support when instructed. CLI 0.3.7 permits the URI stage of a legacy or marked journal to converge on the same URI through its typed recovery path. Known hashes are verified without rebroadcast. Preserve journals and their original wallet material across authorization changes.

`presentation-submit` now checkpoints its wallet result under intent recovery; older CLI builds report stages and observed hashes without that checkpoint. When `resubmitSafe` is true, setting the same URI cannot apply twice; it does not guarantee that a reverted transaction or invalid plan will succeed. Re-read chain state first, and obey authorization/input/precondition errors before retrying. A version-moved or unreadable-manifest conflict requires a newly prepared plan. Never apply this same-plan guidance to creating a Skill or version.

## Browser presentation overrides and Legacy creator signatures

The Browser Manage page can override listing text, individual HTML detail tabs, cover and related Skills. These overrides are distinct from MCP/CLI publication or version presentation updates: a new version does not implicitly clear an existing Browser override. Use the supported Browser restore action for the specific field or tab when the user wants the published source again; restoring the full presentation also clears related-Skill selections. Do not invent CLI override commands.

For Legacy Skills whose contracts support creator attestation, only the original deploying wallet can provide the signature, even if ownership has transferred. The Browser switches to the Skill's chain before requesting the signature and records it with a separate transaction. A stored signature cannot be overwritten. Unsupported contracts offer no signing action, and attestation is provenance rather than a quality endorsement. Obtain explicit user authorization for signing and the transaction; a request to edit presentation does not authorize attestation.

## WebP covers and detail images (CLI 0.3.5+)

Use CLI 0.3.5 or newer when a valid WebP cover or packaged detail image was rejected as an unsupported image. This version detects image signatures from raw bytes, including WebP headers whose binary file-size field is not valid UTF-8. Upgrade the executable and retry the failed local validation with the same source; preserve any existing publication journal and follow its recovery instructions if a transaction was already submitted. Existing image types and size limits still apply.
