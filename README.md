# How to use Finchtech (Finch) CLI

The official Agent Skill for operating Finch Agent, Task, and Skill markets through the Finch Remote MCP and the locally installed Finch CLI.

The Skill entry point is [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md). It routes market-specific work to the maintained references under [`references/`](references/).

## Official runtime

- CLI package: `@finchtech/cli`
- Required CLI version: `0.4.0` or newer
- Primary command: `finch` (`finchtech` is only a compatibility alias)
- Remote MCP: `https://www.finchtech.ai/mcp`

```bash
pnpm add --global @finchtech/cli@0.4.0
finch --version
```

CLI 0.3.1 is required for new SkillRoot publications and encrypted downloads, including historical encrypted Skills. Upgrade the CLI as well as this Skill; installing these instructions does not upgrade the executable. See [Skill publication and delivery](references/skill.md) for ZIP import and compatibility rules.

## Authenticated downloads (CLI 0.3.8+)

All Skill downloads now require an active CLI login, including plaintext packages that need no purchase or holding. CLI 0.3.8 sends the Session bearer to the official delivery gateway and acknowledges the verified download before saving the file. Upgrade the executable as well as this Skill; follow [delivery and recovery](references/skill.md) if authentication or acknowledgement fails.

## Legacy FinChip CLI

The former `finchip-cli` npm package and the `use-finchip-cli` Skill are deprecated and are no longer maintained. Do not use them for Finch.

Remove the legacy package before installing the current CLI so that old command shims cannot be mistaken for Finch:

```bash
npm uninstall --global finchip-cli
pnpm add --global @finchtech/cli@0.4.0
finch --version
```

The historical Skill repository remains available only as a migration notice and audit record: [`FinchipAI/how-to-use-finchip-cli`](https://github.com/FinchipAI/how-to-use-finchip-cli).

## Source and releases

The public Skill repository is [`FinchipAI/how-to-use-finchtech-cli`](https://github.com/FinchipAI/how-to-use-finchtech-cli). Read the instructions and references here, and find versioned downloads under [Releases](https://github.com/FinchipAI/how-to-use-finchtech-cli/releases). The canonical source is maintained internally alongside Finch's MCP and contract code; using this Skill requires no access to the private repository.

Tagged releases in this repository version the Skill independently from `@finchtech/cli`.

The website also serves Skill resources built from its deployed maintenance source. Website resources, this public repository's versioned release, and the installed CLI can therefore have different release dates; updating one does not publish or upgrade the others.

## MCP connection without a Browser (CLI 0.4.0+)

CLI 0.4.0 lets an Agent connect its MCP client to Finch without a Browser. `finch mcp connect -- <MCP_CLIENT_LOGIN_COMMAND...>` runs the client's own login command and approves the one authorization URL it prints; `finch mcp authorize --stdin` approves a URL the Agent copied unchanged; the command shown on the Finch authorization page still works when neither is possible. Loopback callbacks are delivered directly to the client on this machine, and HTTPS callbacks still open in the Browser. The Finch authorization server now returns the RFC 9207 `iss` parameter and refuses older CLI releases with an upgrade instruction. See `SKILL.md` for the order in which to try these entry points.

## Diagnostic and interoperability fixes (CLI 0.3.9+)

CLI 0.3.9 provides the following diagnostic and interoperability fixes. Upgrade the installed executable with the installation command above; a website deployment or Skill refresh alone does not deliver these fixes.

- `finch mcp doctor` inspects current and legacy wallet/key binding without migrating legacy files, bounds each remote read to 15 seconds, and treats client guides as informational. Its report removes `mcp.supportedClients` and retains `compatibilityManifestUrl`; `ready` still covers only CLI Session and MCP discovery, with Harness OAuth `not_checked`. Consumers should use the checks and readiness scope rather than the removed field.
- OAuth discovery accepts advertised capability reordering and additional capabilities while retaining resource/issuer authority. Authorization accepts registered default scopes when the request omits them, and compares callback targets, original query values and state independently of parameter order or opaque code length; explicit scopes remain checked.
- Cover upload follows the server-prepared byte limit and accepted media types, checking actual file bytes. Task award signing accepts equivalent JSON object key order while keeping the EIP-712 field-array order, names, types and authority exact.

Older CLI versions retain their historical guide checks and legacy-wallet migration behavior during doctor. A guide error does not prove the service is down or authorize replacing a wallet, clearing recovery state, or bypassing signing checks.

CLI 0.3.7 automatically stages multipart uploads above 4,000,000 bytes and shares a 30 MiB final package limit across upload and download. It reads manifests with authorized external media and reports publication, presentation and legacy-recovery progress. Browser publishing retains its multipart limit and rejects external media. Follow [publication diagnostics and recovery](references/skill.md#publication-diagnostics-and-recovery-cli-037) before retrying; source ZIP limits do not include final metadata or encryption overhead.

`finch mcp doctor` checks the CLI Session and MCP discovery, not the Harness's OAuth credentials. Its `harnessOAuth.status` is `not_checked`; compare the connected MCP identity with `finch status` and use native Harness reauthorization when needed. This release does not claim to fix production intent availability, manifest availability or OAuth persistence. Updating this Skill does not upgrade the installed CLI.

## First wallet and partial diagnostics (CLI 0.3.4+)

To keep an existing identity on a fresh installation, use `finch wallet use --file <PATH>` with an owner-only file containing the existing private key. Import is offline; never paste the key into a command or chat. Creating a new wallet creates a different identity and requires an explicit choice. Import is blocked when wallet files are damaged, local authorization remains, or recovery is pending. Restore damaged wallet files from backup. For orphaned authorization, restore the original wallet or explicitly use `finch logout --local`; never delete transaction journals to bypass recovery. Existing Account switching requires login and successful remote revocation before changing the current wallet.

Run `finch login --help` to read production authentication-chain IDs (1, 10, 56, 8453, 42161). For example, `finch login --chain-id 56` selects an authentication chain only; the server validates support and market plans determine transaction chains.

`finch mcp doctor` reports `checks.endpoint`, `wallet`, `session`, `remoteSession`, and `mcpDiscovery`, each with `ok`, `missing`, `invalid`, `unavailable`, or `skipped`. Read the JSON even when exit code is 2: `ready: false` includes actionable guidance. Missing local state does not prevent independent discovery; invalid endpoint configuration prevents network checks. Exit code 0 means the required checks passed, within `cli_session_and_mcp_discovery` only. Harness OAuth remains `not_checked`; verify the mounted MCP identity with `identity_actor_get` against `finch status`. CLI 0.3.4 also rejects malformed OAuth UUID responses rather than silently accepting them.

## WebP image detection (CLI 0.3.5+)

CLI 0.3.5 fixes valid WebP covers and packaged detail images being rejected when binary file-size bytes were decoded as UTF-8. Upgrade the installed CLI to receive the local detection fix; website or Skill updates alone do not update the executable. Image types, size limits, and publication recovery rules are unchanged.

## Market category compatibility (CLI 0.3.6+)

Use CLI 0.3.6 or newer for the expanded market categories. Skill response display categories now accept bounded text, so future taxonomy additions do not require another CLI upgrade. Updating the website or this Skill does not upgrade an installed CLI.
